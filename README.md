# Legal Structure of DAOs

A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a community that operates without a centralized authority. However, certain projects may require the management of tangible assets or interaction with legal entities. Depending on the goals and actions of a project, it may be necessary to establish one or more legal entities.

The following table outlines some activities that a DAO may undertake and the reasons why a legal structure may be necessary in each case. It is important to note that you should always seek the advice of legal and tax professionals when setting up legal entities and considering the potential legal, tax, and other implications.

| Activity                                   | Why Legal Structure                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Venture & Investments    | Sign SAFTs, SAFEs and other legal documents; Bank accounts |
| Labs, Operations                           | Talent recruitment; Bank account; Hold IP interests         |
| Token Sales                                      | Sign sale docs; KYC/AML procedures                        |

# Legal Structure for DAO projects

A typical legal structure for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that primarily operate outside of the United States is a combination of a Cayman Foundation Company and a British Virgin Islands (BVI) subsidiary.

One key benefit of using a Cayman Foundation Company is the flexibility it offers. The constitutional documents of a foundation can be customized to align with the unique goals and objectives of a DAO. Additionally, foundations do not require shareholders, making them a suitable option for organizations that do not prioritize ownership and profit.

Another popular location for DAOs to establish operational entities is the British Virgin Islands (BVI). A common strategy is to establish a BVI subsidiary of a Cayman Foundation, allowing DAOs to take advantage of the benefits offered by both jurisdictions.

# Legal Principles for DAOs

DAOs can adopt various legal structures, such as traditional corporations, tech stacks, boards, and centralized committees, to facilitate real-world transactions and investments for project teams. The focus should be on quickly establishing the legal structure and operations, with plans to decentralize and automate them in the future.

### Aligning Foundation Constitutional Documents with DAO Mandates

The constitutional documents of a foundation govern the relationship between the DAO and the foundation. When creating these documents, the project team should consider:

- The scope of activities that are in and out of bounds
- The selection and replacement of directors/committee members
- The rules and procedures for decision-making

### Jurisdiction Diversity

DAOs and digital assets are inherently global and may not be restricted to any particular jurisdiction. Therefore, defaulting to a "setup in Delaware" legal structure may not be the most efficient option for DAO projects. To the extent that activities are conducted outside of the United States, the legal structure should also be located in a non-US jurisdiction.

### Incentivizing Contributors

To attract and retain top talent for DAO projects, such as venture management, research, and product development, a competitive compensation mechanism should be designed. For example, the project team could earn carry interest on investments, or receive a share of equity interest or token earnings for early-stage product development.

### Compliance

The project team should obtain advice on AML and other compliance matters in all relevant jurisdictions prior to any offering and conduct all necessary AML and compliance checks for fundraising and token offerings in accordance with applicable laws and best practices.

### Isolating Risks and Activities

Each entity involved in a DAO project has specialized activities and compliance requirements and should be kept separate where possible. This is especially important for entities involved in token creation and sales, as these activities may involve different risks than those associated with the operation and hiring entities of the DAO.
